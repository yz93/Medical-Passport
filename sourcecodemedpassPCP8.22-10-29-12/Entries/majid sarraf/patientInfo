Children who attend to schools in this area, are of wealthy immigrants from China. The school recently had to revise its lunch policy, due to the mother?�s oversolicitousness for their children?�s education. Also, the cultural premium parents place on education has helped make Blandford the top performing elementary school in the district.
As there is a bright side, there is also a dark side. In this area, close to 40% of the businesses in Industry are ethnic Chinese owned. Even though it is not mentioned explicitly in this article, but we can infer from the scarehead, and the content of the article that this is a closed society. There is a popular saying, ?�Do in Rome as the Romans do.??Even though they are prosperous, and their children receive a great quality of education, they have to know how to associate with other ethnic groups, since they are a part of American society. If they only enjoy themselves living in their enclaves, some of them might experience conflict due to cultural difference. And children who will get jobs out of their society in the future, might have to deal with cultural difference between different ethnic groups, and have hard times dealing with it.
In conclusion, the majority of the residents in San Gabriel Valley are Chinese. The economy in this area is thriving, and they are enjoying luxurious life while maintaining their own Chinese tradition. However, if they only remain as a close society they might have conflict with different ethnic groups and this will affect the future of their children and their society.
The article describes the problem of illegal immigration in American society. The reporter Steve Lopez made an interview with Escondido City Councilman Sam Abed. Abed was a legal immigrant who earned U.S. citizenship by marriage. Abed told the reporter how he became such an immigration hard-liner.
Since it was a good place to raise a family, Abed and his wife settled in Escondido 20 years ago. However, his dream to raise a family in a peaceful place lost its luster due to the flooded illegal immigrants in town. Abed insisted that illegal immigrants dragged down the quality of life; school struggled, and gang activity increased.
The reporter quoted the statement made by the former San Diego County assistant sheriff that city officials have misrepresented crime stats and exaggerated the number of illegal residents, blaming them for everything without considering their contribution to the local economy. The reporter argued this matter with Abed, and Abed showed a list of 2,615 arrested people in the last six months of 2007 as a counter-evidence for the retired sheriff?�s statement. 25% of the arrests turned out to be illegal residents. Since the reporter knew that quibbling over the number of arrested illegal residents and whether checkpoint stops were worth the cost was wasting time, he changed the subject to immigration reform.
The article describes about the recent prosperity of the new so-called Chinatown in the eastern San Gabriel Valley, California. Since America is a multicultural, multiethnic nation, there are many immigrants from various countries. Chinese and Taiwanese are one of the ethnic groups in America, who tend to live in their own enclaves.

Unlike most of the Chinese enclaves, San Gabriel Valley is economically stable. People in this area drive luxury cars, and live in luxury houses. Also, they have ideal institutions, and amenities in vicinity. They even have the top performing schools in the district.
People in San Gabriel Valley say that they have brought the Chinese tradition in America. They run their business in Chinese way. They serve homemade lunch every day to employees of their enterprises. People who came from China, and settle down in this area don?�t have a chance to improve their English. This is because of the similarity to Chinese environment rather than American environment. People in this area use Chinese, and they even follow the Chinese way, and culture in America.
Abed talked about the political parties??perspective on illegal residents and his brother?�s moving story from Lebanon to America legally. The Republicans want the cheap labor, while the Democrats want Latino voters. And the legal immigration process for those who are well-educated is really retarded. This wink-and nod policy of the government sends mixed signal to the illegal immigrants, and this increases the cost to prevent illegal immigration.
